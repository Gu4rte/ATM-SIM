# ATM-SIM

-Simple ATM that performs basic transactions, (login, check balance, deposit, withdraw).

-Checks database to see if user and password matches, keeps track of balance even if program is shutdown.

-Logs every transaction each user makes, with date, user, amount and type of transaction to a individual file.

-Handles errors

I did this while doing the 'Automate the boring stuff' course, wanted to test if I actually learned anything about reading files and updating them.
